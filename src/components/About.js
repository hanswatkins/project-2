            <p class="about-paragraph">I began my career as a freelance music producer. I was invited to record at Spotify's recording studio in Los Angeles, developed partnerships with Universal Music Group and Bluenote Records, and made music for every major "24/7 lofi beats to study to" live stream out there. Now my curiosity is leading me in the direction of Software Engineering. In June I enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive and I'll be graduating with over 500 hours of engineering experience in August 2022.</p>
